# JavaScript Spider entrypoints

The shared module boundary accepts ES module default/named exports and CommonJS
exports. Sources may export an object, or a synchronous class with Spider methods;
the class is instantiated once when its retained source session is created.

CommonJS dependency preloading scans literal `require(...)` calls. Comments,
quoted text, regular expressions and template text do not create dependencies;
real calls inside template expressions do. This prevents a nonexistent example
path in a source comment from causing an HTTP 404 before execution. Computed
module names still need their modules supplied by the imported package.

The host continues to call its existing short entrypoints. When a short method is
absent, the shared facade delegates to the corresponding full method:

| Host call | Full Spider method | Adaptation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `home(filter)` | `homeContent(filter)` | Preserve the boolean |
| `homeVod()` | `homeVideoContent()` | No arguments |
| `category(id, page, filter, extend)` | `categoryContent(...)` | Page is a string; keep the filter object |
| `detail(id)` | `detailContent(ids)` | A scalar becomes a one-element array; an existing array stays flat and preserves duplicates/order |
| `search(word, quick, page)` | `searchContent(...)` | Page is a string, default `"1"` |
| `play(flag, id, vip)` | `playerContent(...)` | Preserve flag, opaque ID and VIP array |

Existing short methods take precedence. Calls keep the original source instance
as `this`, preserve synchronous values and Promises, and propagate source errors.
The facade does not mutate frozen exports or module namespaces. Missing methods
remain missing; no fabricated lists or playback URLs are returned.

For a source using only full entrypoint names, `init` receives a string. Flutter
keeps the original imported string value separately from the existing normalized
`site.ext`, including leading/trailing whitespace. This survives source copying,
source-session identity and backup/restore. An object-valued `ext` is serialized
as JSON; its original textual formatting is not claimed to be preserved. Legacy
short-name or mixed-name sources retain their previous init argument types.

Legacy `__jsEvalReturn` sources can use the same method aliases, while retaining
their Cat init metadata (`stype`, `skey`, `ext`) and existing detail-array calling
convention. Python, DRPY and CatPaw use their separate existing adapters.

Entrypoint compatibility alone does not supply the complete current FongMi host
API. A separate [bounded CatVod profile](catvod-profile.md) provides the `Spider`
base class and selected network/utility APIs; unimplemented host exports remain
unavailable rather than becoming empty stubs. The independent class fixtures in
the entrypoint tests declare their own methods. Current full-name signatures and
the separate host-module requirement are documented in the upstream
[Spider guide](https://github.com/FongMi/TV/blob/4512b4c9f82534ff66acfde06ccdd68f35b074f0/website/app/spider/page.tsx).

Verification: `scripts/test_js_module_interop.cjs` exercises the shipped shared
loader in Node; `flutter/test/js_full_spider_test.dart` executes the same asset in
the production QuickJS bridge, including imported JSON, local ZIPs, class state,
full-name playback through the local proxy, raw extensions and backup restoration.
These tests are not physical-device or media-decoder acceptance.

At `698e165`, [iOS native run 42406788685](https://github.com/Pilipala9919/MarcoMovie/actions/runs/42406788685)
passed 192 unique checks on each of ARM64/iOS 26.2 and x86_64/iOS 18.5.
Four new checks exercise the complete entrypoints in production QuickJS. All
30 recorded production inputs and 11 fixture inputs match that exact commit.
[Android 6 run 42406788581](https://github.com/Pilipala9919/MarcoMovie/actions/runs/42406788581)
passed 67 source-host checks, including nine new complete-entrypoint checks,
along with the home and subtitle probes. This is an API 23 x86 emulator;
the reported APK hashes originate from its build, not a separately downloaded
APK inspection. These results predate the separate CatVod host-module work.

[Full iOS build 42407255923](https://github.com/Pilipala9919/MarcoMovie/actions/runs/42407255923)
at `9caf3c6` passed 266 Flutter tests and produced an unpublished validation IPA.
Independent inspection verified ZIP integrity, 19 pinned DRPY assets, exact
shared JS/Python host bytes and 37 device-arm64 Mach-O images targeting iOS 14
or earlier, including the exported operation-deadline function. The IPA is
35,267,783 bytes, SHA-256
`c4b474dad160c145e6af7d637bf4acd32e91bcdc0096e20405502e12816ee375`.
It also predates the CatVod host-module changes and does not satisfy the
physical-iPhone playback or remaining plugin-route publication gates.
